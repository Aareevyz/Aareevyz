# Hi there, I'm Alive (Ar-leave) 👋

## From Project Engineering to Data Engineering
I am a former **Project Engineer** transitioning into the world of **Data Engineering**. With a solid background in engineering workflows and project management, 
I’ve combined my problem-solving roots with modern data technologies to build robust, scalable data infrastructures.

I recently completed an intensive Data Engineering bootcamp at **Westride**, where I honed my skills in building end-to-end data pipelines and managing cloud-native data environments.
